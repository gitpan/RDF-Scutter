RDF-Scutter version 0.02
========================

As the name implies, this is an RDF Scutter. A scutter is a web robot
that follows C<seeAlso>-links, retrieves the content it finds at those
URLs, and adds the RDF statements it finds there to its own store of
RDF statements.

It is a LWP::RobotUA, inheriting all the abilities of that class,
including the ability to be nice to remote servers, heeding robots.txt
and so on. Also, it uses the excellent and widespread RDF::Redland
library and builds a Model, which again can be used by other tools. It
can store the retrieved data in any store supported by Redland, file,
memory, Berkeley DB, MySQL, etc.

INSTALLATION

To install this module use the CPAN or CPANPLUS tools or type the
following:

   perl Makefile.PL

   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module depends on RDF::Redland. Note that RDF in general is in
development and changes rapidly. It currently depends on at least
1.0.2.1 (at present not available at CPAN, but from
http://download.librdf.org/ 
and may become incompatible with future versions.

It also depends on LWP, but it is not known to the author if it has
version-specific dependencies.
